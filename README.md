There are 4 main tabs, Types Editor, Market Editor, Market Creator and Event Creator.

Types Editor - lets you load an XML file and either create a market JSON from it, or simply adjust nominal and Min values.

Expansion market Editor - Bulk up[date prices in your JSON files by a percentage. Lets say you want to put on a sale of 50% off. Just put -50 and itll mark things down by that amount.

Market Creator - Load up a types file from any mod, lets say RaG Items. It will look at all the type names and ask you to pick initial stock value as well as min and max prices. 

Event Creator - Creates events, be it vehicles, animals or static (like zombie hordes and such)
